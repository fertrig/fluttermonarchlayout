# Flutter layout problem

I have encountered a puzzling layout inconsistency involving the Wrap, Stack, Chip, and Positioned widgets and I am hoping that the Flutter community can help me resolve it. I have a created a simple Flutter app at <https://github.com/philipmjohnson/fluttermonarchlayout> that illustrates the problem.

To start, here are two images that show the intended layout:
